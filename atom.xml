mechanical keyboard project started by <a href="http://geekhack.org">GeekHack</a>
forum member Dox, and contributed to and refined by many others. It
was offered as a kit on <a href="http://www.massdrop.com">MassDrop</a> starting
in early 2013. After demand for a second run increased, MassDrop
offered a second group buy, which I jumped on and placed my order. As
of this writing, MassDrop is running a <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox">third group buy</a> for the ErgoDox.</p>
<p>This is going to be a review of my time with the ErgoDox, from
construction to roughly a week of use. My kit arrived on June 5th
2013, but I wasn&#39;t able to construct the board until June 16th, due to
the fact that 8 month old babies have an odd temporal vortex around
them that somehow sucks in available free time like a black hole sucks
in matter.</p>
<p>Yup, I spent my first Father&#39;s Day constructing a keyboard. Nerd
achievement unlocked.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I needed to reuse some user controls across multiple webforms
applications. What I wanted was a way for our UI guy to author and develop
these controls using <em>.ascx and </em>.ascx.(cs|vb) code-behind files, since that
was what he knew and was good at.</p>
<p>There’s a couple of ways to do this, some involving embedding the ASCX file as
an embedded resource. I didn’t want to go that route tho. I did find
<a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2005/10/06/using-msbuild-and-ilmerge-to-package-user-controls-for-reuse.aspx">one reference</a> that pointed me in the right direction though. But it wasn’t
quite exactly what I needed. For one, it didn’t play nicely with any other
project references your control library might need. So, using Scott’s post as a
starting point, I came up with a solution that I think works out very nicely.</p>]]></summary>

reinstalled Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is a train wreck. A mess. A disaster. Its user experience is
completely disjointed and confused. What was Microsoft thinking? Windows 7 is,
to date, the best OS they’ve ever released. I would expect version 8
to build upon that success.</p>
<p>Instead, like Frankenstein, they sew on a tablet OS, Metro. Now, Metro is slick.
The Windows Phone 7 experience is refreshing, unified, and completely <em>usable</em>.
But it has zero business being anywhere near my Windows desktop experience. It
just feels wrong interacting with the Metro elements with a mouse pointer. When
I’m on the desktop, it feels natural. I’m doing all the normal things I’ve
always done with my keyboard and mouse, and it works great.</p>
