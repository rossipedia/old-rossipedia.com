          <section class="content"><p>The <a href="http://ergodox.org">ErgoDox</a> is a custom split-hand ergonomic
mechanical keyboard project started by <a href="http://geekhack.org">GeekHack</a>
forum member Dox, and contributed to and refined by many others. It
was offered as a kit on <a href="http://www.massdrop.com">MassDrop</a> starting
in early 2013. After demand for a second run increased, MassDrop
offered a second group buy, which I jumped on and placed my order. As
of this writing, MassDrop is running a <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox">third group buy</a> for the ErgoDox.</p>
<p>This is going to be a review of my time with the ErgoDox, from
construction to roughly a week of use. My kit arrived on June 5th
2013, but I wasn&#39;t able to construct the board until June 16th, due to
the fact that 8 month old babies have an odd temporal vortex around
them that somehow sucks in available free time like a black hole sucks
in matter.</p>
<p>Yup, I spent my first Father&#39;s Day constructing a keyboard. Nerd
achievement unlocked.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I decided to write this review after finishing the
board, so sorry for the lack of pictures.</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>I purchased a FX888D soldering iron from Amazon for the build, and I
already had a roll of solder, which worked find for the build. I
followed along with WhiteFireDragons&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1irVrAl3Ts">excellent video</a>,
and had no problems. I&#39;m pretty sure I lucked way out as I had
everything work perfectly the first time.</p>
<h2 id="supplies">Supplies</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWUFVY8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Hakko FX888D Digital Soldering Iron</a>
(I used the stock tip it comes with)</li>
<li>A roll of 60/40 0.032&quot; Rosin Core solder from Radio Shack</li>
<li>Wire tip cleaner (the one that comes with the FX88D is fine)</li>
<li>A pair of side cutters (if you get the iron off Amazon it comes with one)</li>
<li>Tweezers (<em>REQUIRED</em> for SMDs in my opinion).</li>
<li>(optional) A magnifying glass if your eyes aren&#39;t so good</li>
<li>A ventilated work area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>Construction was pretty simple: I just followed along the steps in the
YouTube video. I did run across a few things I wanted to comment on
though:</p>
<p><strong>SMDs</strong>: These were fairly annoying. On the first PCBs these took me
quite a while (about 3 hours, but that&#39;s with breaks and
distractions). On the second PCB I got much faster results by
soldering only one side of the SMDs for an entire row first, and then
going back and soldering the 2nd lead.</p>
<p>Soldering an individual SMD is fairly straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place a dab of solder on one of the pads.</li>
<li>Place SMD on PCB, and apply tip of iron to the <em>lead</em>, not the pad,
until you feel the SMD drop into the solder.</li>
<li>Solder the 2nd lead.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Teensy 2.0 Micro Controller</strong>: The only thing to be wary of is when
breaking apart the header pins make sure you apply the force
correctly, as I ended up with a row that was one pin too short.
Thankfully the box came with extras.</p>
<p><strong>Micro USB Connector</strong>: Part of the construction of the
ErgoDox requires cutting the male end off of a Micro USB cord and
getting at the internals. In the YouTube video, WFD uses a Dremel
rotary tool to do this, and I will say that if you have one, <strong>USE
IT</strong>. I had no such tool, and had to use a combination of side cutters
and needlenose pliers to extract the internals from the plastic
casing. Not fun.</p>
<p><strong>Resistors</strong>: Neither WFD&#39;s video, nor the
<a href="http://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/assembly/">instructions</a> on
Massdrop explicitly clarify which resistors go where. As I am not an
electrical engineer I had to go figure out which resistors were the
2.2kΩ resistors (the one <em>without</em> the dark brown stripe), and which
were the 220Ω resistors (the ones <em>with</em> the dark brown stripe). If in
doubt, make your resistors look exactly like this (take note of the
resistor stripes and orientation):</p>

<h2 id="final-assembly">Final Assembly</h2>
<p>The case of the ErgoDox consists of 5 laser-cut layers of acrylic
bolted together, and they arrive covered in protective paper adhered
to each side, presumably to prevent chipping while the laser performs
the cut. However, a couple of the layers did end up having chips
anyways, and the paper was burnt in a few places. Not a deal breaker,
as none of the plates were actually broken.</p>
<p>However, one of the plates on the left side had a problem where the
holes for the bolts hadn&#39;t been drilled out completely, and I had to
pop out the left-over plastic burrs that were left in the holes. I
also had to use a small phillips head screwdriver to bore out the
holes until the provided bolts would actually fit.</p>
<h2 id="programming-layout">Programming / Layout</h2>
<p>Following the directions on MassDrop&#39;s assembly page for loading the
firmware on to the board was fairly straightforward and I had no
problem. Rather than repeat them, I&#39;ll link to MassDrop&#39;s page
<a href="https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/assembly/#step-12">here</a>.</p>
<p>I use a fairly sparse layout, which you can view
<a href="https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/?referer=QJGS5L&amp;hash=dc58f1a2f9d5222910e05c6a03b9f90b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been using the ErgoDox for a little over a week now, and for
normal typing (such as this post), I&#39;m back up to 100% speed. However,
my <a href="http://careers.stackexchange.com">dayjob</a> requires writing a lot
of code, and I&#39;d say that due to the special symbols that have to be
used fairly consistently I&#39;m only back up to about 85% of normal
speed.</p>
<p>I put together my board with Cherry MX Clear switches, and replaced
all the springs with 65g springs from
<a href="https://www.originativeco.com/65g-springs">OriginativeCo</a>. These
soften the switches every so slightly, and don&#39;t tire my fingers out
as much as the standard clear springs (which I believe are 67g, but
not sure).</p>
<p>Typing on this board is <em>extremely</em> addicting. The fact that
it is a completely vertical layout (as opposed to staggered like most
standard keyboards) has made a huge difference in how i hold my
hands and fingers (<em>especially</em> for the left hand, the difference is
huge). my hands are more relaxed, and my shoulders are less tense.</p>
<p>All in all, a great purchase and I&#39;m extremely happy with this board.
At $200 for the bare board (add $37 for the
<a href="http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php">DSA</a> keycaps, and from $37-$50
for the DCS keycaps) it&#39;s not for everyone. But if you&#39;re into high
quality mechanical keyboards and like tinkering with electronics, then
I&#39;d highly recommend it. The current group buy for the ErgoDox on
MassDrop ends on June 30th, 2013.</p>
